Problem definition: Suppose we are given a bag/knapsack which can contain items upto weight 'k_w'.  
We are then given the list of items 'n' along with their weights 'i_w' and values 'i_v'.  
We should choose the items in such a way that the capacity of the bag is maximised and is within the weight limit 'k_w'.  
To better understand this, imagine you are on a treasure hunt and found gold coins of different weights.  
Unfortunately for you, you can only choose coins whose total weight will be within your backpack's weight limit.  
How will you go about choosing the right coins?  
The blog post [http://javabypatel.blogspot.in/2016/09/knapsack-problem-solution-recursive-iterative.html] has a very good explanation with example.
