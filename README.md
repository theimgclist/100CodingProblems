# 100CodingProblems

<b>My journey back to Algorithms and Problem Solving</b>    

I used to love solving the coding problems from sites like Codechef, HackerRank etc back when i was in college.  
Having said that, I have to mention that i have never been proficient at it. And adding my 2 years of job in an IT company so far to that, where I spent most of the time fixing bugs, I really miss the joy of solving the coding challenges which involved tyring to find an intuitive way to solve the problem at first and when that failed, try and see if i can use the algorithms(I only know a handful of them really) to solve them.   
After thinking about getting back to my old love, that is Algorithms and Problem Solving for quite some time, i finally made a move(atleast, thats what i think creating a new github account and filling out this Readme file is, a move, my first step towards my former land!)   


It is 12.15pm IST, Friday, 14th of July 2017 as I am writing this.   
I have decided two things about this, which might be contrary to the usual approach of problem solving.  
One, i dont have any plan like solving zero or one or more number of problems per day or week. Plans never worked for me!  
Two, i am not going to spend hours or days trying to crack a problem which i couldnt solve in an hour or so. This is totally against the principle or suggestion of many expert problem solvers who say to solve the problem on your own, no matter how much time it takes.  
The reason for number two is: Being a full time employee for an MNC, if i have to spend hours on a coding problem, i dont think it's going to be productive at the end of the day. So my approach for this will be to solve a problem, by totally understanding it, even if that means i should be going through someone's solution.   
People cite the analogy of Maths when it comes to problem solving, the more you practice the better you get at it. I would like to extend that analogy a bit more to add this: You dont practice addition or substraction or any other operation of Math, without first knowing what that is. You are first taught how addition works, the semantics of it, with multiple examples to cover different cases, and then asked to solve some addition problmes on your own.  
That's what i would be doing in this project. I have chosen geekforgeeks as the source from where i get the problems. I will try to solve the problem on my own at first. If that crosses the threhold duration which is one hour, then i would go for solutions available and see what i can learn from this problem.  
This may not be a recommended approach, but this is how i look at it: Once i am done with solving 100 coding problems, which i am confident and positive about accomplishing, i will gain the knowledge of many new algorithms which i didnt know before, different ways of solving the same problem, get to know many useful blogs and smart coders through the solutions i find online and many more other positives out of it. This i see as a tradeoff against not solving the problems totally on my own.  

I will try to document in detail as much as i can as i go on with this project and i hope this might help any novice programmers who are into problem solving.  

**21st July, 2017:**  

I have started solving challenges from GeeksforGeeks. I started with DP.  
For each problem, I will first code in Java with which I am comfortable.  
Once the java solution works, I will code the same problem in  Python, since i want to get used to that language.  
I found this useful link, [http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/Functions/FlowofExecutionSummary.html] which explains the flow of a Python code which is different to that of Java.
